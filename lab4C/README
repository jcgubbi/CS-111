This is lab4c! Email me with any questions about my submission. I used quite a bit of code from TA slides
in order to get the SSL connection and TCP connections working. There will be a lot of overlap with that.

Included Files:

README - This file with descriptions of all the included files.

Makefile - Compiles the other files and prepares them for submission by compressing them.

lab4c.c - Source code with all relevant code for using TCP connection to send temperature.

lab4c_tls.c - Source code for using TLS connectino to send temperature.
