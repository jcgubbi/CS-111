This is lab 3A! Email me with questions about my submission.

The submission seems to work on all test cases. I used the provided sanity script as well as hand checked the output
against the simple test file system image. They bothed seemed to work perfectly but the testing is limited. It may
fail more robust test scripts.

README: This file with descriptions of each of the files.
lab3.c: Source code with all relevant code for analyzing the file system image.
extfs.h: Header file that is given that has format of the image.
Makefile: File that makes, cleans and packages the above code.
