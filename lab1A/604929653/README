LAB 1A:

There are not any known limitations to my code as of now. The only possible problems would come from test
cases that are outside the realm of the test script. I only tested my code using similar test cases
as the test script itself. 

Contents:

README - This file, with information about limitations. 

lab1a.c - My C source code which compiles to simpsh.

Makefile - Make file that compiles code, tests and can zip it.
